Future

1. The Farm Friend vehicle is no longer viable in its scaled down form.

Being scaled down brought two issues. First, when a player enters a scaled down vehicle, they also scale down by the same amount and it is permanent.
The mod will need to be renamed as Oaks Ant Farm if it remains as the player further scales down on each successive visit to the vehicle.
Furthermore, the scaled down vehicle is not proportional as it appears the vehicle is in separate parts and it does not scale down as a single combined unit.

2. Since the guards were switched to the EntityTrader class, they cannot be healed by a player. This may change as classes change with A21.
