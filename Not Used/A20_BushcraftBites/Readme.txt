Version: A20 Bushcraft Bites - 24th of December 2021
----------------------------------------------------

==========
BACKGROUND
==========
A20 brings a number of changes to the way players acquire and produce their food and drink. It was described as more challenging than A19 during the A20 live streams and feedback from the community has confirmed that.
In keeping with the A20 changes, Bushcraft Bites provides additional recipes for low level players that focus on the 'hunting and gathering' requirements.
This means that farming will continue to play a supplementary role while 'foraging' continues to offer the bulk of nutritional resources.
While players may be able to incorporate farming as a progressive skill as game stage builds, Bushcraft Bites will always be there if things get desperate.

=======
RECIPES
=======
Some recipes are locked behind Master Chef Skill to keep things balanced and proportional to the regular recipes.
Bushcraft recipes use simple, and hopefully, realistically appropriate ingredients that can be made from Skill 0 to Skill 2.
There are no schematics to reflect a 'Bushcraft' concept of learning through trial and error as a matter of survival.
Recipes are split into 4 main areas, in no particular order as follows:

============
INSTALLATION
============
For Players and Server Admin/Hosts who have never installed a mod before, here are some simple step by step instructions:

1. If you've never installed a mod before, it is necessary to create a mod folder in the main directory, typically (\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die).
If you have a custom install or your server host has modified the installation location, then you may have to explore.

2. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature) in your '7 Days To Die' main directory folder.

3. You can now drag the mod folder directly out of the zipped file and it can be placed directly into the Mods folder. However, there may be a top folder which you do not need. You are looking for a folder that contains a 'ModInfo' file. The folder holding that file will be the one you add to your Mods folder. If you add a folder above that nesting then the game will not be able to see the mod. The top layer will be a single folder and in the second layer you will see a ModInfo.xml file with or without additional folders depending on the mod. Clear instructions on this stage are not possible due to different types of unzip application and their methods. However, this will become elementary once you've launched a few mods.

Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES
Do players also need to install this Mod? = NO

The magic of this mod is that is only needs to be installed in the server/person who has launched the main environment that others join. Enjoy.
